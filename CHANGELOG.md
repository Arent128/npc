# Change Log

This file documents the changes made in each release. I didn't start maintaining this until I was in the middle of developing the gui, so it's more sparse than it should be.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) (mostly).

## 1.2.5 - 2017-01-27
### Added
* The readme now has a version badge
* Default settings files have some instructions about their use

### Changed
* Updated copyright date
* Serializable args to the CLI are handled more elegantly. Should have no impact on use.
